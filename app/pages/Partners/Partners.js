                        JavaZone started out in 2002 as a small conference for Java developers but has since then evolved
                        to become one of the largest developer conferences in the world. Each year thousands of people gather
                        in Oslo Spektrum for three full days of learning, mingling, and fun!

                        We want JavaZone‘s Expo Area to be an attractive space where our Partners and participants can hang out and spend time together.
                        In previous years our Partners have done a great job to help us achieve this goal, and we look forward to seeing what they bring to JavaZone 2018!
                        JavaZone’s Expo Area is a vibrant, busy space full of life and activity.

                        We work closely with our Partners to help them realize their ideas and make the most out of their stands.
                        Have you got a great concept for your JavaZone stand and need help to realize it? Don’t be shy - just ask us. Almost anything is possible!

                        All our partner stands are traditionally located in the Expo Area, which is centrally located in the venue.
                        During each break, the Expo is full of attendees. This is partly because we serve food continuously from
                        restaurant stands throughout the day, and partly because of you – our Partners – make this area one of
                        the liveliest Expo Areas of any conference.

                        Don‘t you believe us? Have a look for yourself! Our new Partners are always surprised by the
                        huge attention their stands receive in the Expo Area. We have put together a short 15-second
                        timelapse from 2 hours of Expo time, showing both the flow of people during talks and in the breaks between talks.
                        Yes, you get exposure to that many people, for a total of 20 hours!
